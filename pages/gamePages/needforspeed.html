            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Need for Speed Payback</strong> is a racing game set in an open world environment of Fortune Valley; 
                a fictional version of Las Vegas, Nevada. It is focused on "action driving" and has three playable characters
                 (each with different sets of skills) working together to pull off action movie-like sequences. In contrast with 
                 the previous game, it also features a 24-hour day-night cycle. Unlike the 2015 Need for Speed reboot, Payback 
                 includes an offline single-player mode.
                Payback features a total of 74 vehicles with downloadable contents. Toyota, Scion and Ferrari are not involved in
                 the game due to licensing issues. However, the Subaru BRZ appears in the game. Aston Martin, Audi, Buick, Jaguar,
                  Koenigsegg, Land Rover, Mercury, Pagani, and Plymouth make their return after their absence from the 2015 installment, 
                  while Alfa Romeo, Infiniti, Mini and Pontiac were added via downloadable content.
