            <h3>Series Info</h3>
            <p>Ted has fallen in love. It all started when his best friend, Marshall, drops the bombshell that
                he plans to propose to longtime girlfriend Lily, a kindergarten teacher. Suddenly, Ted realizes
                that he had better get a move on if he hopes to find true love. Helping him in the quest is Barney,
                a friend with endless -- often outrageous -- opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to
                meet women. When Ted meets Robin, he is sure it's love at first sight, but the affair fizzles into
                friendship. Voice-over by Bob Saget ("Full House") tells the story through flashbacks.
